1,The pro version is not very intuitive,"I have used Splitwise for years and it’s been useful when I had to split expenditures with flatmates.
But now as a homemaker, I am really struggling to leverage this app to store collective and individual expenditures.

I can only enter my individual expense on the group I share with my husband. He has to do his data entry by himself. Else we have to choose a “split” option. Why would you force that???
I should be able to do all this data entry by myself, even if I have to do it for the other members in my house!!

The below review is for Pro version:
Charts are restricted to a pie. 
Only absolute nos. no percentage split
No way to see who contributes how much share of the expenditure. 
In this post CoViD world, when all receipts are digital, I don’t see the point of receipt scanning.
Itemisation barely makes sense if you give just limited Color palette for high level items in the charts to start with.
In short, there is no way to analyse the Data if visualisation is so limited. Charge me for subscription but at least make it worthwhile.

It’s turning out to be a disappointing journey in managing expenditures using Splitwise, when one moves from one stage of life to another.",Sukriti19,2021-02-02 14:34:10,False,2,"{'id': 20860120, 'body': ""Sorry you had a negative experience with Splitwise!
